Write a Python script that reads all files in the user-specified source folder and distributes them into subfolders in the destination (output) folder based on their file extensions. The script should perform the sorting asynchronously for more efficient processing of a large number of files.

## To run

python main.py --source path/to/source --output path/to/output
